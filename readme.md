ðŸŒ± Understanding Branches & main in Git (Real-Life Scenarios)
git is used to track changes in the codebase
while github is a cloudplatform to store your repositories
concept of remote :
local repo : git init creates a local repo
remote repo: stored on github/gitlab
to connect to github , to have to connect your project to remote
while creating a repo you come across this : https://github.com/bhabanikantpra2003/mastering_git.git , this is a remote
how to use this : write git remote add origin link
from this intead to typing the repo url everytime we can use the 'origin' keyword everytime , we can have multiple repos , just name them other than origin , because it is already taken

git push -u origin main
git branch branch-name
git checkout branch-name
git checkout main
to create and then move to that branch in one line : git checkout -b branch-name

task
create a new branch
move to that branch
change the readme file
commit to the orinal code in the github

this thing will be channged in the feature branch and not in the main branch
